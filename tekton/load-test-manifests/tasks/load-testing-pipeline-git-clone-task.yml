  description: >-
    These Tasks are Git tasks to work with repositories used by other tasks
    in your Pipeline.

    The git-clone Task will clone a repo from the provided url into the
    output Workspace. By default the repo will be cloned into the root of
    your Workspace. You can clone into a subdirectory by setting this Task's
    subdirectory param. This Task also supports sparse checkouts. To perform
    a sparse checkout, pass a list of comma separated directory patterns to
    this Task's sparseCheckoutDirectories param.
  workspaces:
    - name: output
      description: The git repo will be cloned onto the volume backing this Workspace.
    - name: ssh-directory
      optional: true
      description: |
        A .ssh directory with private key, known_hosts, config, etc. Copied to
        the user's home before git commands are executed. Used to authenticate
        with the git remote when performing the clone. Binding a Secret to this
        Workspace is strongly recommended over other volume types.
    - name: basic-auth
      optional: true
      description: |
        A Workspace containing a .gitconfig and .git-credentials file. These
        will be copied to the user's home before any git commands are run. Any
        other files in this Workspace are ignored. It is strongly recommended
        to use ssh-directory over basic-auth whenever possible and to bind a
        Secret to this Workspace over other volume types.
    - name: ssl-ca-directory
      optional: true
      description: |
        A workspace containing CA certificates, this will be used by Git to
        verify the peer with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS.
